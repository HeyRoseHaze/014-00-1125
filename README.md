# Vocabulary Learning App

A simple desktop flashcard learning app built with Python, Tkinter and SQLite -
inspired by Quizlet. It allows you to create decks, add cards, study them and track your learning progress locally.

This is the first version.
I plan to change the interface to a more modern one. And add some new features.
